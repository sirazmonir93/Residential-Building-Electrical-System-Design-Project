- A = Area in m²

**Room-wise Calculations**:

- **Bedrooms**: 2 tube lights + 2 fans each
- **Living/Dining**: 3 lights + 2 fans
- **Kitchen**: 2 light bulbs
- **Toilet**: 1 light bulb
- **Garage**: 11 light bulbs
- **Ancillary rooms**: Appropriate lighting as per usage

**Electrical Load Calculations**

**Power Formula**:

text

I = P / (V × pf)

Where:

- I = Current (Amperes)
